DRY

Don't Repeat Yourself

Every piece of knowledge should have a single, unambiguous, 
authoritative source of representation.

Single Source of Truth

Duplication of effort, not just duplication code.

We have seen duplication in code, but it goes well beyond that...
If we do manual testing, that is a violation of the DRY principle
If we do manual deployment, that is a violation of the DRY principle

Violation of DRY increase the cost for organizations and lowers
productivity
