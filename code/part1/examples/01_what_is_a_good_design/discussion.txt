Characteristics of Good Design:
-Simple
-Fewer moving parts
-Relevant
-high cohesion and loose and low coupling

Cohesion:
Code that does one thing and only one thing really well
Narrow and focused
That changes less frequently
The cost of change is minimized

Coupling:
Low instead of high coupling
Loose instead of tight coupling

Fewer dependencies and also more flexible dependencies

Both low and loose coupling
