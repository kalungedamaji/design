What is extensibility?

-The code can do something different than before, based on the 
requirements, with minimum cost and effort for change.

A piece of code can't be arbitrary extensible.

For a code to be extensible we have to anticipate some types of change.

Who can anticipate such changes in general?

There are 3 kinds of people on every team that makes software:
1. Those who know software design really well but know nothing about 
   the domain
2. Those who know the domain really well but know nothing about 
   software design
3. Those who know the domain and software design really well 
4. (we will politely ignore this group)

To anticipate we need a good knowledge of the domain and software 
design constraints and capabilities.

Because most people are in group 1 or 2, we have to collaborate to
create extensible design.

OK, we can anticipate but are there other thing we can do....
