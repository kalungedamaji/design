Tight coupling often makes design hard to extend.

As much as possible favor loose coupling and low coupling to make
design extensible.

Fewer things to depend on lowers fragility
The more abstract a dependency is, the more extensible the design is.

We should not use these blindly and need to evaluate tradeoffs and
give due consideration.

Do not blindly create interfaces for every dependency.
